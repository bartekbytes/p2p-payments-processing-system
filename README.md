# Project Background

This project was developed as part of a job application assignment for a fintech company.
Its goal was to demonstrate the ability to design and implement a simplified yet realistic
payment processing system supporting peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions.

While the system includes core features such as batch and streaming ingestion, data validation, monitoring, and reporting,
it is **not intended to be a production-ready solution**.
Certain simplifications and assumptions were made to fit the scope and timeframe of the assignment.

The project serves as a showcase of backend architecture, data engineering, and monitoring skills
that can be extended and adapted for real-world use cases.
